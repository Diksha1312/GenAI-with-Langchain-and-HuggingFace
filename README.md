# GENAI Project Roadmap

This project is structured to progressively build your understanding and skills in Python programming, machine learning, deep learning, and modern AI techniques, particularly focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Python - Revisiting Basic Concepts of Python Programming 

This step involves a thorough review of the essential concepts of Python programming to ensure a strong foundation for the upcoming topics.

### Step 2: Basic Machine Learning for NLP [IN PROGRESS]

In this step, you'll explore the fundamentals of machine learning, specifically tailored for natural language processing tasks.

### Step 3: Basic Deep Learning for NLP

This step covers the basics of deep learning applied to NLP, including:
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)**
- **Bidirectional RNN**
- **Encoder & Decoder Models**
- **Sequence to Sequence Models (Seq2Seq)**
- **Attention Mechanism**
- **Transformers**

### Step 4: Generative AI and LLM (Large Language Models)

This step introduces generative AI techniques and dives into the concepts and applications of large language models.

### Step 5: LangChain and OpenAI

In this step, you will learn to use LangChain and OpenAI to build advanced language models and integrate them into applications.

### Step 6: Hands-On

The final step involves hands-on projects to apply all the concepts learned throughout the course. This step includes building and deploying your own models and systems.
